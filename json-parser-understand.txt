# json-parser.cc
a recursive parser in general

ParseJson is the top function for processing of js json (I guess)
it calls ParseJsonValue
and deals with errors

inside ParseJsonValue
it calls ParseJsonString, ParseJsonNumber, ParseJsonObject, ParseJsonArray

inside ParseJsonString
return ScanJsonString<false>()

inside ParseJsonInternalizedString
return ScanJsonString<true>();

inside ScanJsonString


ok
so inside json there might be numbers, strings, objects, or arrays
but we only pay attention to the strings

patch is inside SlowScanJsonString and ScanJsonString
which is called by itself(recur) and 
ScanJsonString
in old version, what does ScanJsonString do?


in new version
ParseJsonString/ScanJsonString is ScanJsonString
old: return ParseJsonString();
new: value = MakeString(ScanJsonString(false));


global variables?

in new version, do we have something under ScanJsonString?
probably need to update tainttracking::OnNewFromJsonString




what does tainttracking::GetWriteableStringTaintData(*seq) do
DisallowHeapAllocation no_gc
